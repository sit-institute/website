Taking place many years in the future in colonized space, military scientists have disposed of countless, defective military droids on an un-colonized terrestrial planet called Ryxx. The droids eventually become sentient and, by way of revenge, start an attack against mankind, using a station to continually create more war machines. It is the player's mission to undergo Project X and eliminate the droid forces.

## Gameplay


Players control a spacecraft of their choice, battling hundreds of alien ships. Various [power-ups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-up), frequent in the first level, but progressively rare afterwards, permit an exponential increase of the spacecraft's seven different weapons (Guns, Buildup, Side Shots, Homing Missiles, Plasma, Magma, and Laserbeam).


The game is composed of five levels. Many players never completed the second one (which had a very difficult ending), and most of the rest never went past level three. When Team17 realized this, they released _Project-X SE_ on [Amiga CD32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_CD32), a special edition with the difficulty toned down. It was released as a budget game.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-X#cite_note-Budget-1) A hack for the original game to enable the player to skip levels by holding down the fire button and pressing the escape key was also distributed on the coverdisks of several Amiga magazines.
